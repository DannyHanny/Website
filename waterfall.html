	<p>
	The Waterfall model is a sequential/linear model. After each stage has been completed, the next stage can begin. You may have to return to previous stages, for example 
	if you are at the testing stage and you want to go back to the analysis stage you need to go through the coding and design stages first.

	<ul>
		<li>Requirements - The system and software requirements are gathered from questionnaires and observations and are needed to build the software.</li>
		<li>Analysis - The software is looked at with TELOS feasibility. TELOS stands for technical, economical, legal, operations and schedule.</li>
		<li>Design - When designing the software flowcharts, structure diagrams and data dictionaries are used to design it. </li>
		<li>Testing - Testing will have different stages for example going from alpha to beta in development depending on how much of the software is completed.</li>
		<li>Maintenance - There is several different types of maintenance such as corrective, perfective and adaptive. Maintenance means keeping the released product usable in changing environments.</li>
	</ul>

		Pros of The Waterfall Model:
		<ul>
			<li>Loads of documentation</li>
			<li>An easy to understand process</li>
			<li>Scheduling and arranging tasks</li>
		</ul>
		</p>

		Cons of The Waterfall Model:
		<ul>
			<li>If requirements are misunderstood it may be too late to change</li>
			<li>Efficient code is not prioritised</li>
			<li>Working software is not produced until the end of the cycle meaning it may be too late to change</li>
			<li>Users are not needed until testing</li>
		</ul>
