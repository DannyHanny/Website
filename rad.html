			Rapid Application Development is used to refer to methodologies that use prototypes and iteration. The prototype is tested and evaluated by customers until it is improved upon enough to become the final product.
		</p>
	</div>
	
	<div>
		<p>
		Pros of RAD:
		<ul>
			<li>Encourages customer feedback
			<li>Should result in a great product with excellent usability
			<li>Less development time
			<li>Changing requirements can easily be accommodated for
		</ul>
		</p>
	</div>
	
	<div>
		<p>
		Cons of RAD:
		<ul>
			<li>Efficient code is not prioritised 
			<li>Takes away from the customers time in return for feedback
		</ul>

	<h2>RAD- The Spiral Model</h2>

		<p>
		The spiral model, documented in 1988, adds the RAD prototyping and risk analysis to the waterfall model and spilits the cycle into four quadrants.
		</br> These quadrants are:
		<ul>
			<li>Quadrant 1- Determine the objectives, alternatives and constraints of the software that is being built.</li>
			<li>Quadrant 2- Look at risks of the alternatives and objectives. The project may be stopped if the risks are too high. A prototype will also be created.</li>
			<li>Quadrant 3- The prototype will be developed here.</li>
			<li>Quadrant 4- The next phase of the project is planned.</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
	</div>
	
	<div>
		<p>
		Pros of The Spiral Model:
		<ul>
			<li>Great for risky and complex projects as the risks are analysed</li> 
			<li>Changing requirements can easily be accommodated for</li> 
			<li>Users see the system early</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
	</div>
	
	<div>
		<p>
		Cons of The Spiral Model:
		<ul>
			<li>Harder for management meaning costs could be increased</li>
			<li>Complex process</li>
			<li>A good risk analysts are expensive</li>
			<li>Efficient code is not prioritised</li>
		</ul>
